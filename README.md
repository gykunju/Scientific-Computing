## Python Basics Project

### Objective

This project contains three Python scripts that cover fundamental programming concepts, including data types, control structures, and modularity. The scripts are structured as follows:

1. datatypes.py - Demonstrates Python data types and type conversions.

2. control_structures.py - Implements control structures like loops and conditional statements.

3. modular_functions.py - Implements functions to calculate the area of different geometric shapes.

### How to Run the Scripts

Each script can be executed independently using Python 3. Follow these steps to run them:

### Running datatypes.py

```python
python datatypes.py
```


This script:

Defines variables of various data types (int, float, complex, list, tuple, dict, set, and bool).

Prints the type of each variable.

Converts an integer to a float and vice versa.

### Running control_structures.py

```python
python control_structures.py
```


This script:

Takes user input to check if a number is even or odd.

Generates a list of even numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.

Uses a while loop to print numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse order.

Contains a function to classify numbers as even or odd.

### Running modular_functions.py

```python
python modular_functions.py
```


This script:

Defines a function calculate_area(shape, dimension1, dimension2=0) to compute areas for circles, rectangles, and triangles.

Calls the function multiple times with different values.

Uses math.pi for calculating circle areas.

What I Learned

Through this exercise, I gained hands-on experience in:

Understanding and utilizing different Python data types.

Implementing control structures like loops and conditional statements.

Writing modular code with functions for better reusability.

Using mathematical calculations and functions in Python.

Managing version control using Git and GitHub for project collaboration.
